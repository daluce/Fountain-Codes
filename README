CS 51 Final Project: Fountain Codes

These are implementations of fountain code algorithms written in OCaml.
Implemented algorithms will include Luby transform (LT) codes and Tornado codes.

********************************************************************************

File Manifest
    droplet.ml    - defines the Droplet, containing a seed, the XOR'd data, and 
                    the total number of pieces
    
    fountain.ml   - defines the Fountain, produces Droplets according to the 
                    fountain code implementation chosen
    
    goblet.ml     - defines a Goblet, used to collect Droplets and reconstruct 
                    the original data. This takes a droplet (seed, the data to 
                    be decoded, and the total number of pieces)

    operations.ml - contains actual usage of our droplet, fountain, and goblet 
                    classes - hence "operations"

    experiment.ml - sandbox for testing new ideas

    test_framework.ml,
    pretty_print.ml   - contain the CamelJockey testing framework

Configuration
TODO

Operating Instructions
make sure open Droplet is commented out at the top of both fountain.ml and goblet.ml and save
ocaml top level
#use "droplet.ml";;
#use "fountain.ml";;
#use "goblet.ml";;
let f = new lt_fountain "this is the string to encode" 1 5;; (* 1 is the only option for the first number...  *)
let d = f#output_droplet;; 
let gob = new lt_goblet d 5;;

now you have set up a fountain and a goblet 
to create a new 

gob#get_droplet (f#output_dropet);; (* this creates a droplet and feeds it to the goblet  *)

gob#decode (* this attempts to decode the droplets that it has not decoded already  *)

gob$get_message (* this outputs the message as it is now   *)

(* other useful debugging  *)
gob#get_all_metadrops
gob#get_solved_singles
gob#print_progress
